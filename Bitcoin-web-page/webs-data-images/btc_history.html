		<h3> The History of Bitcoin</h3>
		<p>
			The concept of Bitcoin was put into action in 2008 by an unknown person or collection of people who go by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2009 Bitcoin was formally released. Bitcoin operates on an open-source network known as blockchain technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			This means every purchase with a Bitcoin is stored in the public view and cannot be altered. Unlike fiat currencies, handling Bitcoin is attractive because it does not involve third parties like VISA or Mastercard, and therefore, you do not need to pay a fee to these entities when making transactions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bitcoin also overcomes some problems with cross-border payments and has been known to help unbanked populations. Regardless of its price fluctuations, it is worth considerably more than when it was first released just over a decade ago.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Pre-history:</h4>

		<p>
			Prior to the release of bitcoin there were a number of digital cash technologies starting with the issuer based 

			<!-- Linked text-->
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash">ecash</a> 

			protocols of David Chaum and Stefan Brands. Adam Back developed 

			<!-- Linked text-->
			<a href="https://paybis.com/blog/what-is-hashcash/">hashcash</a>,

			 a proof-of-work scheme for spam control. The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity based cryptocurrencies were Wei Dai's 

			 <!-- Linked text-->
			 <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/B-money">b-money</a>

			  and Nick Szabo's 

			  <!-- Linked text-->
			  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo#Bit_gold">bit gold</a>

			  . Hal Finney developed reusable proof of work (RPOW) using hashcash as its proof of work algorithm.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			In the bit gold proposal which proposed a collectible market based mechanism for inflation control, Nick Szabo also investigated some additional enabling aspects including a Byzantine fault-tolerant asset registry to store and transfer the chained proof-of-work solutions. The possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto was a computer collective in the European financial sector has also been discussed.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>2009:</h4>
		<p>
			In January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the first open source bitcoin client and the issuance of the first bitcoins, with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the first block of bitcoins ever (known as the genesis block), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text:
		</p>
		<br>
		<p id="p">
			The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			One of the first supporters, adopters, contributor to bitcoin and receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was programmer Hal Finney. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released, and received 10 bitcoins from Nakamoto in the world's first bitcoin transaction. Other early supporters were Wei Dai, creator of bitcoin predecessor b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bitcoin predecessor bit gold. Before disappearing from any involvement in bitcoin, Nakamoto in a sense handed over the reins to developer Gavin Andresen, who then became the bitcoin lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation, the 'anarchic' bitcoin community's closest thing to an official public face.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p id="p1">
			How much was bitcoin worth in 2009? It is one of the most popular questions about the history Bitcoin. The value of the first bitcoin transactions were negotiated by individuals on the bitcoin forum with one notable transaction of 10,000 BTC used to indirectly purchase two pizzas delivered by Papa John's. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in bitcoin's history.
